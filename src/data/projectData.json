        "description": "Hearing the Forest is an immersive tree planting experience set in a virtual forest at night. By talking to NPCs in the scene, players get a unique seed for every new conversation and can use these seeds to plant trees. Every tree is unique, even for those that grow from the same seed. Tree planting comes with a chime melody, enhancing the chilling atmosphere.\nHearing the Forest invites players into an interactive, meditative experience where every conversation with an NPC becomes a seed of creativity. With each seed plant, a one-of-a-kind tree blossoms before the player’s eyes, shaped by the magic of L-systems. No two trees are alike—even those grown from the same seed. It’s both a visual and audio experience: as the player plants a tree, a delicate chime melody plays, resonating with the tree growth and adding to the soothing ambiance. It's more than planting a tree — it’s planting a moment of peace.",

Next, we conducted primary research including transect tours and interviews to gain deeper insights into our stakeholders. Finally, we ideated and prototyped a new NYC subway in-station signage index system, gathered feedback from A/B testing, and did one iteration over our intervention.\nThis project was done by Cassandra Mao, Chenyi Wang, Fuguo Xue, and Hanwen Gu.",
